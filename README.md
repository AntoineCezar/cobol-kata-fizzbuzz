# COBOL Fizzbuzz Kata

I used the FizzBuz kata as a mean to teach myself COBOL.

Started as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/AntoineCezar/946a09c2917d27592717d17e8497a834)
it's now maintained here.

## Requirements

* gnu-cobol
* make

## Quick Start

* To run the program: `make run`
* To run the tests: `make test`

## TODO

* [x] Make it works
* [x] Make it tested
* [x] Make it copies (COBOL's include directive)
* [ ] Make it with assertion subroutines
* [ ] Remake it the TDD way
